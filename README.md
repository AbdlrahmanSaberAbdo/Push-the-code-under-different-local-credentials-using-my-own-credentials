Push the code under different local credentials using my own credentials
Hi everyone,



I want to share something I realized while I'm working on a freelance project, it was the first time I know it and I don't know what's the purpose of it.



In the video, I'm showing that I'm in a private repository on GitHub ( you can test it on different sites like bitbucket, GitLab). 



let's say I'm working with 2 developers in the same repository, and I know the email of someone in the repo or someone who's not in the repo If I changed the git configuration (email, name) in my local repo to one of my teammate's email and name 



then let's say I made a change to the code and push it to GitHub, or any other git provider (Gitlab, bitbucket), when you go to the commits to see who has pushed the code it'll show that it's not you, it's your friend but the reality is that you pushed the code.



I just want to know what's the purpose of it?! it's easy to push the code under different accounts and make some suspicious code and when checking who has pushed this code it will be not you, so anyone who wants to make something bad in the code with a different email will have the ability to do it?



please anyone who knows what's the purpose of using my own credentials and changing the local git configuration to a different user and then push the code and when pushing the code it'll show in the commits that it has been made by someone else however I'm the one who pushed the code using my own credential
